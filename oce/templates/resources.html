    <!-- Paragraph under subtitle -->
    <p class="lead">
        Children are affected either detrimentally or beneficially by the well-being and behavior of their peers, 
        therefore, it is imperative, that all children and teens in our communities, receive the best upbringing possible 
        at home, at school, and in their neighborhoods. 
        Working to provide every child with the best possible nutrition and environment 
        for learning, playing, and resting is an ongoing challenge for parents, educators, healthcare providers, 
        and community leaders. Foundations for our future require ensuring every child has what they need to thrive. 
        Every child’s well-being impacts not only their peers but also the entire community, shaping the future of our towns and neighborhoods. 
        When children grow up in supportive, nurturing environments, we all benefit. 
        This is why it’s essential that all children and teens have access to the basics—proper nutrition, 
        safe spaces for learning, play, and rest, and the guidance they need to thrive. 
        Investing in the health and happiness of every child is an investment in the well-being of our communities. 
        Together, parents, educators, healthcare providers, and community leaders can help build a brighter future for all by ensuring every child has the foundation they need.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
        When we unite to identify the essential resources every student needs to thrive and reach out to every home through trusted institutions and charities, 
        we set a positive domino effect in motion—one that builds support, opportunity, and resilience across our entire community.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
        Our goal with this initiative its to help every family gather these items for the children in their home. 
        We cannot guarantee that we will be able to provide you with the items you need. 
        We will do our best to connect with charitable groups who can provide these items. 
        If you are able to provide items on this list to families in need, please contact us at <b> 859-333-9790 </b>.
